<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Day by day and night by night<br />
		it’s getting colder in me.<br />
		My fear is rising.<br />
		Would she be ok?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Come home my girl, come home,<br />
		come home to your family, come home.<br />
		Come home my girl, come home,<br />
		come home to your family, come home to me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The fear of never seeing her again,<br />
		the fear of not finding her,<br />
		the hope to close her save in my arms,<br />
		the pain of not knowing anything.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Come home my girl, come home,<br />
		come home to your family, come home.<br />
		Come home my girl, come home,<br />
		come home to your family, come home to me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Seeing a shadow in the garden.<br />
		Imagine it would be you<br />
		to find freedom again, to find freedom again,<br />
		to know you’re ok.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Come home my girl, come home,<br />
		come home to your family, come home.<br />
		Come home my girl, come home,<br />
		come home to your family, come home to me.
