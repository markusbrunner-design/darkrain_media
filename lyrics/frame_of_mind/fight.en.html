		It’s a human fault,<br />
		won’t and can’t be sensible,<br />
		won’t and can’t be responsible.<br />
		I can’t see, I can’t find.<br />
		There will be another war again.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And we fight &ndash; tell me will it ever stop?<br />
		And we fight we fight.<br />
		And we fight we fight.<br />
		And please let it stop.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I don’t see myself as a victim,<br />
		I don’t think the whole world is against me.<br />
		I am a because so are you,<br />
		so are you, such as you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And we fight &ndash; tell me will it ever stop?<br />
		And we fight we fight.<br />
		And we fight we fight.<br />
		And please let it stop.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Afterwards the most of us feel sorry,<br />
		expecting about what we’ve done wrong.<br />
		But all the &quot;I must, I must have&quot;<br />
		are just forming circles, circles.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And we fight &ndash; tell me will it ever stop?<br />
		And we fight we fight.<br />
		And we fight we fight.<br />
		And please let it stop.
