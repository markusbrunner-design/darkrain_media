<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down from my throne.<br />
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down from my throne.<br />
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I left my crown behind.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I can’t remember that she was really angry<br />
		but I know how I hate myself right then.<br />
		Now it’s easy to see<br />
		that everybody was in a fight with me &ndash;<br />
		wasn’t easy for me, wasn’t easy.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down from my throne.<br />
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I left my crown behind.<br />
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down from my throne.<br />
		The day when I went down.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		For me it’s like the first breath to feel alive again.<br />
		I feel the sun and I taste the rain <br />
		and I said &quot;I feel alive again&quot;.<br />
		I’ve found the way and I’m sure, yes I’m sure<br />
		that there will be more.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down from my throne.<br />
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I left my crown behind.<br />
		The day when I went down,<br />
		the day when I went down from my throne.<br />
		The day when I went down.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I feel the sun and I taste the rain<br />
		and I said &quot;I feel alive again, alive again&quot;.<br />
		I feel the sun and I taste the rain<br />
		and I said &quot;I feel alive again, alive again&quot;.
	</p>
