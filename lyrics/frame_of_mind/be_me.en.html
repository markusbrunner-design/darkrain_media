<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Reminding tonight the dark wish was there again.<br />
		I saw me in the biggest glamour light<br />
		and the others losing in the shadow of mine.<br />
		I felt good and so damn ugly inside.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		There is a voice that says<br />
		&quot;Someday you’re just like everybody else.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		You will not look better,<br />
		you will not smell better,<br />
		you will not say better,<br />
		you’re just like everybody else.&quot;<br />
		I don’t want to, I don’t want to be different.<br />
		I just wanna be me, me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		When I was young I dreamed of being a princess<br />
		or hold the greatest powers in my hands.<br />
		I could make the stars explode<br />
		and everybody will look up to me.<br />
		Now I’m looking up searching.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		There is a voice that says<br />
		&quot;Someday you’re just like everybody else.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		You will not look better,<br />
		you will not smell better,<br />
		you will not say better,<br />
		you’re just like everybody else.&quot;<br />
		I don’t want to, I don’t want to be different.<br />
		I just wanna be me, me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Oh why?<br />
		Oh why?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The voice, the voice,<br />
		that voice said me ...
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		There is a voice that says<br />
		&quot;Someday you’re just like everybody else.
