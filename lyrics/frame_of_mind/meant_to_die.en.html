<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		It’s not your fault.<br />
		How could it?<br />
		Our love was meant to die.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Don’t want to see tears in your shiny eyes &ndash;<br />
		they are too beautiful to cry.<br />
		There’s no need to explain our lies<br />
		cause that’s so far away<br />
		like us both now after all.<br />
		No I don’t want you to hate yourself.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		It’s not your fault.<br />
		How could it?<br />
		Our love was meant to die.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Of cause we will stay friends,<br />
		friends for all the time in our lives.<br />
		Maybe in the future we will see the sense.<br />
		Hey look at me, listen to me,<br />
		please do not blame yourself.<br />
		Our feelings &ndash; we couldn’t rescue them,<br />
		couldn’t rescue them.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		It’s not your fault.<br />
		How could it?<br />
		Our love was meant to die.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Now give me your hand,<br />
		promise me you will try to forgive me.<br />
		Look at me and tell me that you understand.<br />
		Love will come to you again, you will see<br />
		and I’m no longer in your heart,<br />
		punishing you so deep inside your soul.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		It’s not your fault.<br />
		How could it?<br />
		Our love was meant to die.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		So give me a last kiss to carry our love to grave.<br />
		There will always be a place in me just for you.<br />
		Never I will forget this love now gone,<br />
		now gone, now gone ...
