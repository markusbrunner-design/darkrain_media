		The rose was red<br />
		when I left it on your stairs.<br />
		Your eyes were so tired<br />
		when you looked at me the last time.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I felt so cold<br />
		and I still do<br />
		when I think about<br />
		what happened to you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Somehow I knew<br />
		I was about to lose you,<br />
		lose you ...
