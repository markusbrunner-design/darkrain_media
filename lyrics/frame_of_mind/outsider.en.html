<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		No one hears when his feet touch the ground,<br />
		nobody cares that he doesn’t look up, doesn’t give up.<br />
		A wall of fear followed around,<br />
		a lonesome genius in his world.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The guy with the light skin<br />
		and the whole secret within,<br />
		with the empty eyes<br />
		behind the black hair strains.<br />
		The guy with the light skin<br />
		and the whole secret within,<br />
		with the empty eyes<br />
		behind the black hair strains,<br />
		behind the black hair strains,<br />
		behind the black hair.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Peculiar the world fits to him<br />
		like he’s the shadow following his feet,<br />
		caught in a maiden view<br />
		of a young dreamers head.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		How would I feel by infiltrating<br />
		this world reality,<br />
		made in a human mind, closed in these eyes<br />
		under the mysterious flake of endless tears,<br />
		of endless tears.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The guy with the light skin<br />
		and the whole secret within,<br />
		with the empty eyes<br />
		behind the black hair strains.<br />
		The guy with the light skin<br />
		and the whole secret within,<br />
		with the empty eyes<br />
		behind the black hair strains,<br />
		behind the black hair strains,<br />
		behind the black hair.

		Behind the black hair strains ...
