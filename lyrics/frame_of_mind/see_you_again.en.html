<!-- Liedtext -->

		The lightest blue doesn’t reach me.<br />
		The sun only comes to my skin.<br />
		All this makes me so weird.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And then I see you again.<br />
		And the dark don’t seem so dark anymore.<br />
		And at least for a while,<br />
		and at least as long as I see you smile.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The sky turns black in my world.<br />
		The rain to acid in my world.<br />
		My feelings are mixed,<br />
		taste so strange.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And then I see you again.<br />
		And the dark don’t seem so dark anymore.<br />
		And at least for a while,<br />
		and at least as long as I see you smile.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I wonder if, I wonder if this is me<br />
		in that moment I can see my face in your eyes.<br />
		But the tiniest piece of sense<br />
		makes me hope again.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And then I see you again.<br />
		And the dark don’t seem so dark anymore.<br />
		And at least for a while,<br />
