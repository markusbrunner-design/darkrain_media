		Blue, blue,<br />
		blue shines the water over you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		When they finally found your body,<br />
		when the doctor said &quot;You should go home, maybe&quot;,<br />
		when the policeman turned away his head<br />
		I feel lonely.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Blue, blue,<br />
		blue shines the water over you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		When the watchers came to see,<br />
		when people came up asking me,<br />
		when they finally put the cloth over your white face<br />
		I feel angry.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Blue, blue,<br />
		blue shines the water over you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Don’t ask me &ndash; I will not let you go.<br />
		I can’t accept that,<br />
		I can’t accept that, I can’t accept that,<br />
		I was, I was wrong.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Blue will the water shine over me, too.<br />
		Blue will the water shine over me, too,<br />
		over me, too.
