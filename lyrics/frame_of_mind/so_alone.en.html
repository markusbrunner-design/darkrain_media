<!-- Liedtext -->

		I should be a butterfly<br />
		to fly with you everywhere you are,<br />
		to be with you all the time<br />
		there or here &ndash;<br />
		not important at all, important at all.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I feel it seven days a week,<br />
		twenty four hours a day,<br />
		so alone, so alone<br />
		oh without you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Want to be the cloud there over your head,<br />
		to follow you and keep the rain away,<br />
		to be your smile as you always say,<br />
		to be there over you when you sleep.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Just a little butterfly up in the sky.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I dream my dream of you<br />
		now at the moment.<br />
		And all the time<br />
		missing you come, come,<br />
		come my little flower, come to me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I feel it seven days a week,<br />
		twenty four hours a day,<br />
		so alone, so alone<br />
		oh without you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I feel it seven days a week,<br />
		twenty four hours a day,<br />
		so alone, so alone<br />
		oh without you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I feel it seven days a week,<br />
		twenty four hours a day,<br />
		so alone, so alone<br />
		without you.
