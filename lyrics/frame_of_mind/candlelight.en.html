		Candlelight in my mind,<br />
		candlelight in my mind.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		When the first light runs over my skin<br />
		and the day is just awake from the night,<br />
		the dream of you and me is falling apart again,<br />
		my feelings for you.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And when the candlelight falls against the wall<br />
		it seems to show your face.<br />
		How does it feel<br />
		when your hands run through my hair?<br />
		How did a feeling get so strong?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I can see your face in my mind,<br />
		imagine how you could smile for me.<br />
		And I feel how my heart is getting warm,<br />
		I feel my heart is getting warm.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And when the candlelight falls against the wall<br />
		it seems to show your face.<br />
		How does it feel<br />
		when your hands run through my hair?<br />
		How did a feeling get so strong?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I have an imagination of you in my head,<br />
		I want to keep, I want to be real.<br />
		My view of you the man I see in you,<br />
		a longing for you to be here just for me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And when the candlelight falls against the wall<br />
		it seems to show your face.<br />
		How does it feel<br />
		when your hands run through my hair?<br />
		How did a feeling get so strong<br />
		in me?
