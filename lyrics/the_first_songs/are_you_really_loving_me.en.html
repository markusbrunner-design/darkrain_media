<!-- Liedtext -->

		It was a beautiful day and so were you.<br />
		Flowers in your hair,<br />
		looking like flames in the summer sun.<br />
		In your mind there’s no fear,<br />
		she’s wild and free, having fun.<br />
		You’re far away from earth,<br />
		away in dreams, in dreams with me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Never seen a face like yours before.<br />
		Never seen such a smile.<br />
		How many days shared we?<br />
		Let’s drift away for a while.<br />
		Hear your voice around me.<br />
		I want to stay forever right there.<br />
		Don’t you feel I really care?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		How I enjoy the time with you,<br />
		being next to you, feeling your skin.<br />
		Can you feel my heart beating, too?<br />
		Your lovely face, in front of me.<br />
		Somebody like you, I’ve never seen<br />
		before in my overcrowded life.<br />
		Miles away you seam to be.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?<br />
		Are you really loving me?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		How should I know?<br />
		Tell me, tell me how.<br />
		Cause you never, no you never,<br />
		said to me, to me,<br />
		to me ...
