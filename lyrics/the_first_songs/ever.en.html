		What’s your problem, you asked<br />
		But I can’t say what I don’t know<br />
		Why are you so terrible, you asked<br />
		But I never saw it like that.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		If you scream at me<br />
		I won’t say anything<br />
		And if you call me every insult you know<br />
		I won’t even look at you<br />
		But never never I said never<br />
		think of us again,<br />
		think of us again.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		You are so enthusiastic in breaking everything, you said<br />
		But I thought I could help people in doing so<br />
		It’s always the same with you, horrible, you said<br />
		But I thought you’d enjoyed the time with me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		If you scream at me<br />
		I won’t say anything<br />
		And if you call me every insult you know<br />
		I won’t even look at you<br />
		But never never I said never<br />
		think of us again,<br />
		think of us again.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		God damn, you said while standing in front of me<br />
		But I never wanted God to be involved.<br />
		Why are you doing this to me, you asked<br />
		But I can’t see anything that I’ve done wrong.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		If you scream at me<br />
		I won’t say anything<br />

		think of us again,<br />
		think of us again.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I see how you’re screaming at me<br />
		I see you so angry without reason<br />
		What the hell is your problem, you asked<br />
		And I said, and I said: Only you,<br />
		only you, only you.
