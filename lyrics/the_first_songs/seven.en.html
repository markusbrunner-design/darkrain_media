<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Beauty is all over the world<br />
		but a little piece in you is ugly<br />
		look out the window and see people<br />
		Nice and that little piece makes you hate
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The seven will come over you, too<br />
		sin will be at all!<br />
		No smile today? No smile today?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Inside of you is hiding what your face<br />
		would never show to the world<br />
		hate, arrogance and fear tortures your sweet heart.<br />
		Hold your hands and fast your brain clear<br />
		and fast your brain clear.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The seven will come over you, too<br />
		sin will be at all!<br />
		No smile today? No smile today?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And if you just ask yourself<br />
		if you’re really able to harm anyone<br />
		with your dark wishes and fantasies<br />
		Keeps you alive keeps you frightened,<br />
		keeps you frightened.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The seven will come over you, too<br />
		sin will be at all!<br />
		No smile today? No smile today?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And If you ever try to leave it all behind<br />
		you know you can’t;<br />
		it will always find you deep within your dark weak soul<br />
		‘cause sun will never shine there, shine there.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		The seven will come over you, too<br />
		sin will be at all!<br />
		No smile today? No smile today?<br />
		The seven will come over you, too<br />
		sin will be at all!<br />
		No, No smile today? <br />
		No smile today, today ...
