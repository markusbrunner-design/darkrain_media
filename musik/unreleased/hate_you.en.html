<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I know that look in your eyes &ndash; I hate you.<br />
		I know that smile,<br />
		you take your power and make you up &ndash; I hate you,<br />
		using your being over me like a weapon.<br />
		Oh, you feel so important.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I will live when you are lying.<br />
		I will breath when you are dying.<br />
		I hate your satisfied smile.<br />
		You feel so vital but I will bring your fall.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Sometimes I would like to say I hate you,<br />
		but I can’t into your face,<br />
		cause you’re a little king with a audience<br />
		waiting for you to end.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I will live when you are lying.<br />
		I will breath when you are dying.<br />
		I hate your satisfied smile.<br />
		You feel so vital but I will bring your fall.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Someday you will look to me<br />
		and be envious,<br />
		because I made it without you.<br />
		No throwing stones at you,<br />
		but you knew you couldn’t get me,<br />
		you couldn’t break,<br />
		you will never stop me.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I will live when you are lying.<br />
		I will breath when you are dying.<br />
		I hate your satisfied smile.<br />
		You feel so vital but I will bring your fall.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I will bring your fall.
