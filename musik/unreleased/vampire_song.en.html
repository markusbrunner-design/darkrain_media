		One day I lost my shadow,<br />
		I felt the darkness grow,<br />
		I became fear<br />
		for all of you out there<br />
		one day. Oh don’t you pray?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I promised to myself<br />
		that I will never die.<br />
		And then there was no more light.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		One day I lost my shadow,<br />
		I felt the darkness grow,<br />
		I became fear<br />
		for all of you out there<br />
		one day. Oh don’t you pray?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I went out in the night<br />
		and I never felt so alive.<br />
		The blood was running out.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		One day I lost my shadow,<br />
		I felt the darkness grow,<br />
		I became fear<br />
		for all of you out there<br />
		one day. Oh don’t you pray?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I can still hear the screams.<br />
		I can still feel the red life within.<br />
		I can’t forget the taste,<br />
		oh I can’t forget the taste,<br />
		I can’t forget the taste,<br />
		oh I can’t forget, can’t forget ...

		One day I lost my shadow,<br />
		I felt the darkness grow,<br />
		I became fear<br />
		for all of you out there<br />
