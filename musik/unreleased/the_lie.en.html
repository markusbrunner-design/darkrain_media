<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		Wouldn’t it be so empty with you?<br />
		Some nights I feel sorry for some of my faults,<br />
		but it’s so hard to find the right way.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I went into the light<br />
		and I did what I thought was right.<br />
		And now I’m here alone &ndash;<br />
		maybe I was wrong.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		There have been many changes in my life.<br />
		Some of my decisions, I have made,<br />
		they were not right.<br />
		Some were &ndash; let’s say &ndash; I’m not really sure.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I went into the light<br />
		and I did what I thought was right.<br />
		And now I’m here alone &ndash;<br />
		maybe I was wrong.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I hated the rules,<br />
		the things we were<br />
		used to, used to do in every day<br />
		I think it was it to leave and not to stay.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		And I went into the light<br />
		and I did what I thought was right.<br />
		And now I’m here alone &ndash;<br />
		maybe I was wrong.
