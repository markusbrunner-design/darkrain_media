<!-- Liedtext -->
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		What can I say if you don’t listen?<br />
		What can I show if you don’t watch?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I’m sick of fighting,<br />
		sick of hearing you both,<br />
		saying ugly words, worst words.<br />
		This is not a family this is hell to me.<br />
		Hating you for doing this<br />
		to someone you call your baby.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I often think about trying it again,<br />
		trying to reach your attention.<br />
		Should I give up? Should I give up<br />
		and make my own way?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		See all the happiness around me<br />
		and the mess in my home, in my heart.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		In the night my mind disappears,<br />
		going on a journey watching<br />
		the sun rising again in a better world.<br />
		I think I’m jealous at that beauty I’m missing.
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I often think about trying it again,<br />
		trying to reach your attention.<br />
		Should I give up? Should I give up<br />
		and make my own way?
	</p>
	<p class="inhalt1" align="center">
		I see myself in a brighter light.<br />
		I see myself new.<br />
		I see myself strong enough<br />
		to leave you<br />
		and make my own way.
